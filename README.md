# HeartDiseaseAnalysis
This project explores heart disease prevalence based on various demographic and behavioral factors using real-world health survey data. Through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization in R, we uncover patterns related to smoking status, gender, age groups, and their correlation with heart attack history.

##  Project Focus
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)-Cleaned and summarized patient data with missing value handling and factor re-grouping.
- Feature Engineering-Re-coded `SmokerStatus` into categorized `SmokerGroup` for better analysis.
- Visual Insights- Used `ggplot2` to explore heart disease patterns across smoking status and sex.
- Data Source- Heart disease survey dataset (2022) with demographic and behavioral features.

##  Key Insights
- Strong association between current smoking and heart attack prevalence.
- Gender-based comparison of heart disease risk.
- Impact of age categories on disease risk distribution.

##  Technologies and libraries Used
- R
- R Markdown
- ggplot2
- dplyr, tidyverse

> Created as part of the Data Visualization with R coursework at the University.
