This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##The graph shows that smoking history affects heart disease risk. Among men, approximately 18% of current smokers have had a heart attack, compared with about 10% of ex-smokers and only 6% of never smokers. Among women, the pattern is the same approximately 15% of current smokers have heart disease, compared with 8–9% of ex-smokers and 5% of never smokers. This strongly suggests smoking—especially recent smoking—is highly linked with heart disease, and men are only slightly more affected.

The number is also high (over 15,000) for the 75–79 group. In contrast, younger people like those aged 18–24 or 25–29 have almost no cases of both. This shows that as people age, their chances of having both heart disease and stroke increases a lot.

This shows that body weight (and maybe BMI) is important factor for having heart disease.

Overall, the proportion of individuals who had a heart attack remains stable, ranging from 4.5% to 6% across all categories.Among those who have never used e-cigarettes, about 6% reported a heart attack, regardless of alcohol consumption. A similar trend is seen in those who do not currently use e-cigarettes, with heart attack rates around 5–6% for both alcohol users and non-users.For e-cigarette users (either daily or occasionally), heart disease rates are slightly lower, ranging from 4.5% to 5%, with little difference between alcohol consumers and non-consumers.In conclusion, the data suggests that neither e-cigarette use nor alcohol consumption has a strong or consistent association with heart disease, as heart attack rates do not show significant variation with these factors.

The larger the balloon, the more people are in that group, and the color tells if a heart attack has happened to anyone in that group. The largest group is formed by women who do not have angina or heart disease, which amounts to about 90,000 patients. In men with angina, a large number also have heart disease, and this is displayed with dark balloons filling the space under the signs for angina . For this reason, angina is strongly connected to heart disease, mostly in males. Angina indicates that a man is at higher risk, so it should be use  as an early indicator.

#This graph illustrates how flu vaccination, heart disease, and COVID-19 are tied together. It looks at three groups: Some are people without COVID, some are people with COVID-19, and some have a positive result from a home test. The pattern is always the same among all three groups. Heart disease is more common among those who are vaccinated. Among people who have been vaccinated for COVID, close to 50% have heart disease, while this percentage is as high as 30% for those not vaccinated. This suggests two things: Getting a flu vaccine does not prevent heart disease, so it could be that those who choose not to be vaccinated are actually healthier, therefore lowering their chances of heart disease.

#It plot looks at the relationship between BMI (Body Mass Index) and having or not having heart disease. Those people who don’t have heart disease are shown on the pink curve, while the blue curve contains information on people who do. Majority of people in both groups fall in the group called overweight, with a BMI ranging from 25 to 30. The Pink curve (for those with no heart disease) is higher and thinner, which means their BMI’s are somewhat less spread out and their average is lower. Compared to the other group, the blue curve (heart disease group) is flat and goes higher, even up to a BMI of 40. It means that such people often have a greater range and higher BMI scores. Even though the difference is minor, it suggests that having a higher BMI may increase the chances of heart disease. In short, almost all individuals with or without heart disease usually have a BMI of 25–30, yet heart patients are probably to have a BMI that is higher.

#The heat map illustrates that heart attacks have the strongest link with angina, with a correlation of 0.43. This makes sense because chest pain, known as angina, is typically linked to heart disease. Heart attacks are also loosely connected to stroke (0.18), diabetes (0.15), and COPD (0.14). Among the various diseases, the closest to heart attacks are angina, stroke, and diabetes, but there is a weaker link with respiratory, kidney, and autoimmune conditions.

#The mosaic plot is the relationship between BMI and heart disease. It seems that larger bars denote higher categories of BMI. The vertical segments in each of the BMI bars indicate the percentage with and without a heart disease. With the eyes, heart disease appears higher in the overweight and obese categories than normal weight one. The proportion of heart disease underweight is lowest.

#Chisquare Test: The mosaic plot implies this relationship, with the proportion of heart disease becoming higher with increase in BMI categories. This finding is dramatically supported by the fact that a statistically significant Chi-Square test (p < 2.2e-16) provides confirmation for a non-random association between these two variables in the dataset. In the youngest member the Underweight category the lowest percentage of cases of heart diseases are recorded.

#This multiple regression model with HadAngina, CovidPos, FluVaxLast12 and PneumoVaxEver indicates several statistically significant predictors of heart attacks. More PhysicalHealthDays, higher BMI and Angina ( coefficient of “Yes") are associated with the higher estimated probability of heart attack. Surprisingly, the more MentalHealthDays shows a mild lower correlation. SleepHours is not statistically significant. Significant associations are also seen among various CovidPos categories and FluVaxLast12 status. The Adjusted R-squared of the model has skyrocketed (literally) to nearly 0.204, meaning a generally better, albeit moderate explanation of the variance in heart attack.
